# ASM-Tetris
This project was created with 2 of my CS classmates ([@tomimara52](https://github.com/tomimara52), [@tpeyronel](https://github.com/tpeyronel)) as an assignment for the subject Computer Organization. 
Full Tetris game created in ASM emulated in a raspberry pi 3b with QEMU.

Play with $make runSGPIOM in one terminal and $make runQEMU in a different one.

The game IS resizeable and you can play in anything from a 4x4 board to a 50x50 board or different rectangles. Re-size it by changing the BOARD_WIDTH and BOARD_HEIGHT constants in the app.s file. 

Rotate     - W \
Move Right - D \
Move Left  - A \
Hard Drop  - S \
Restart    - SPACE
